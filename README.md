Hi there! About me: I am currently in my third year of my undergraduate. Currently, I am pursuing a dual major with a focus on the Bioscience and GIS tracks in Environmental Sciences and Geography, respectively. I fell in love with GIS while taking Foundations of GIS with Neal MacDonald. I am very interested in mass wasting events and one of my favorite things to do in ArcGIS is monitor post-fire landscapes. I have enjoyed my time at Iowa and am excited for what I might do with GIS in the future!

In this repository, are my assignments and quizes that I have worked on this semester in GEOG:3050. This repository acts a place where I can store my codes, any files, and view revision history. 

Attached is my CV
