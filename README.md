Hi there! About me: I am currently in my third year of my undergraduate. Currently, I am pursuing a dual major with a focus on the Bioscience and GIS tracks in Environmental Sciences and Geography, respectively. I fell in love with GIS while taking Foundations of GIS with Neal MacDonald. I am very interested in mass wasting events and one of my favorite things to do in ArcGIS is monitor post-fire landscapes.

I have enjoyed my time at Iowa and am excited for what I might do with GIS in the future!
